### User class

Probably need to create a class to represent a User and all of its data (like name and age)

User class needs to have the ability to store some data, change the data, and retrieve it. 

Also needs to have the ability to notify the rest of the app when some data is changed. 

Data needs to be persisted and be able to be retrieved at some future point.
